<Q>how is depression diagnosed and treated</Q>
 <A>the first step to being diagnosed is to visit a doctor for a medical evaluation  certain medications  and some medical conditions such as thyroid disorder  can cause similar symptoms as depression  a doctor can rule out these possibilities by conducting a physical examination  interview and lab tests  if the doctor eliminates a medical condition as a cause  he or she can implement treatment or refer the patient to a mental health professional 
once diagnosed  a person with depression can be treated by various methods  the mainstays of treatment for depression are any of a number of antidepressant medications and psychotherapy  which can also be used in combination 
for severe  treatment resistant depression  studies have been done showing deep brain stimulation may be an option 
</A> 
<Q>why is depression more prevalent in women than in men</Q>
<A> depression is twice as common among women as among men  about 20 percent of women will experience at least one episode of depression across their lifetime  scientists are examining many potential causes for and contributing factors to women’s increased risk for depression  biological  life cycle  hormonal and psychosocial factors unique to women may be linked to women’s higher depression rates  researchers have shown  for example  that hormones affect brain chemistry  impacting emotions and mood 
before adolescence  girls and boys experience depression at about the same frequency  by adolescence  however  girls become more likely to experience depression than boys  research points to several possible reasons for this imbalance  the biological and hormonal changes that occur during puberty likely contribute to the sharp increase in rates of depression among adolescent girls  in addition  research has suggested that girls are more likely than boys to continue feeling bad after experiencing difficult situations or events  suggesting they are more prone to depression 
</A> 
<Q>what is postpartum depression  ppd</Q> 
 <A>women are particularly vulnerable to depression after giving birth  when hormonal and physical changes and the new responsibility of caring for a newborn can be overwhelming  many new mothers experience a brief episode of mild mood changes known as the “baby blues ” these symptoms usually dissipate by the 10th day  ppd lasts much longer than 10 days  and can go on for months following child birth  acute ppd is a much more serious condition that requires active treatment and emotional support for the new mother  some studies suggest that women who experience ppd often have had prior depressive episodes 
</A> 
<Q>what happens during menopause with regards to the brain and depression</Q>
 <A>menopause is defined as the state of an absence of menstrual periods for 12 months  menopause is the point at which estrogen and progesterone production decreases permanently to very low levels  the ovaries stop producing eggs and a woman is no longer able to get pregnant naturally  during the transition into menopause  some women experience an increased risk for depression  scientists are exploring how the cyclical rise and fall of estrogen and other hormones may affect the brain chemistry that is associated with depressive illness 
</A> 
<Q>what about depression later in life</Q>
 <A>for older adults who experience depression for the first time later in life  other factors  such as changes in the brain or body  may be at play  for example  older adults may suffer from restricted blood flow  a condition called ischemia  over time  blood vessels become less flexible  they may harden and prevent blood from flowing normally to the body’s organs  including the brain  if this occurs  an older adult with no family or personal history of depression may develop what some doctors call “vascular depression ” those with vascular depression also may be at risk for a coexisting cardiovascular illness  such as heart disease or a stroke 
</A> 
<Q>what efforts are underway to improve treatment of depression</Q> 
<A> researchers are looking for ways to better understand  diagnose and treat depression among all groups of people  studying strategies to personalize care for depression  such as identifying characteristics of the person that predict which treatments are more likely to work  is an important goal 
</A> 
<Q>what is the most promising recent development to treat depression</Q>
 <A>the ability of ketamine to produce a rapid and efficacious antidepressant response by a completely novel mechanism is considered by many experts the most important finding in the depression field in 50 years  originally developed as an anesthetic  ketamine is an antagonist of the nmda receptor on a subset of brain cells  it often produces rapid  within hours  antidepressant actions in patients who have failed to respond to conventional antidepressants  i e   are considered treatment resistant   ketamine is psychoactive and has potentially dangerous side effects  it has a past history of being abused as a street drug  studies aimed at characterizing the mechanisms by which ketamine works rapidly and effectively in severely depressed individuals is likely to lead to novel targets and agents that are safer and more long lasting  and could revolutionize the treatment of depression  numerous bbrf grants support this work  including a number that are attempting to develop ketamine analogs – compounds that act like ketamine but lack its side effects 
</A> 
<Q>what is treatment resistant depression</Q>
<A> treatment resistant depression  trd  is a term used in clinical psychiatry to describe cases of major depressive disorder that do not respond to standard treatments  at least two courses of antidepressant treatments   for many people  antidepressant treatment and or ‘talk’ therapy  such as cognitive behavioral therapy  ease symptoms of depression  but with treatment resistant depression  little to no relief is realized  treatment resistant depression symptoms can range from mild to severe and may require trying a number of approaches to identify what helps 
</A> 
<Q>how can treatment resistant depression be treated</Q>
 <A>treatment of resistant depression has most commonly been treated with electroconvulsive therapy  ect   ect has been modified to avoid the pain previously associated with it and is the most effective and quick acting treatment for resistant depression  the downside is that it works by inducing brain seizures and can impair memory  its therapeutic benefits can also fade over time  new methods of brain stimulation also offer the possibility of relief  these technologies exploit the fact that the brain is an electrical organ  it responds to electrical and magnetic stimulation to modulate brain circuits and change brain activity  repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation  rtms   pioneered by dr  mark george with the support of narsad grants  was approved by the fda in 2008 as a treatment for some otherwise untreatable depressions  rtms is a noninvasive method that works through a coil held over the target area of the brain  a magnetic field passes through the skull to activate the appropriate brain circuit and no seizures are induced  deep brain stimulation  dbs   a technique adapted for treating depression by dr  helen mayberg with the support of narsad grants  works through electrodes planted deep in the brain  another method  vagus nerve stimulation  vns   stimulates the vagus nerve in the neck to therapeutically activate brain function  magnetic seizure therapy  mst  combines rtms and ect to achieve a safer form of seizure therapy  mst has been supported through narsad grants to dr  sarah lisanby  recently  foundation grantees at the university of pittsburgh have successfully experimented on a small number of patients with treatment resistant depression  discovering underlying metabolic deficiencies and successfully treating these  in one subset of patients  a deficiency in cerebral folate was addressed by administering folinic acid  patients’ depression symptoms declined significantly when these metabolic problems were treated  for some individuals  depression reached remission 
</A> 
<Q>what ideas are on the horizon for better  more effective ways to treat depression</Q>
<A> the first attempts at defining depression as a biologically based illness hinged on a theory of a ‘chemical imbalance’ in the brain  it was thought that too much or too little of essential signal transmitting chemicals—neurotransmitters—were present in the brain  this idea has been useful—that the brain is a kind of chemical soup in which there may be too much dopamine or too little serotonin  but it is now begin replaced by much more sophisticated knowledge about how the brain works  made possible by basic research  all the current antidepressants were developed during the period when the chemical soup theory was in vogue  but now  many researchers are looking to understand in greater detail the brain biology that underlies depression’s symptoms so that novel therapies can be found 
throughout this website you will find ideas for new depression treatments in greater detail  efforts to create new classes of antidepressants  based on novel targets have borne fruit  a docking port on brain cells called the mu opioid receptor is the focus of one such effort  other efforts focus not on the serotonin pathway  as do current “ssri” drugs such as prozac  but another pathway  that of another key neurotransmitter  called glutamate  a previously obscure brain area called the lateral habenula may be involved in depression pathology in some instances  due to glutamate hyperactivity  a drug able to specifically lower the activity in that region is a plausible drug discovery objective  other researchers have been working on the idea that drugs that can mimic the biochemical and biological factors rendering certain people resilient to factors such as severe or chronic stress may have a future in depression treatment  a drug is now being tested that in preliminary trials has helped to reduce postpartum depression  other researchers have been studying the ability to help women resist depression in the perinatal period through hormone treatments  or  in other work  via treatments that target the maternal immune system  which may be implicated in a subset of postpartum depression  research has begun to see if administering certain strains of bacteria in depressed individuals might give a boost to their immune system and help reduce depression symptoms  trying to alleviate depression via changes in diet – e g   a mediterranean diet  in one recent study – or omega 3  “fish oil”  supplements is the subject of other foundation supported research  yet another path that may lead to better outcomes in the future is bright light therapy  which was first used to help people with seasonal affective disorder  it may have wider applications  it is also important to note research by grantees that has suggested the ability of even a short course of talk therapy to help alleviate depression in mothers with major depression  while at the same time helping their children  such therapy worked best when it focused on the mother’s relationship with her child  the research revealed 
</A> 
<Q>can brain scans guide treatment for depression</Q>
 <A>brain imaging has confirmed the biological nature of many psychiatric illnesses over the past twenty years  yvette sheline  m d   in the mid 1990s  used functional magnetic resonance imaging  fmri  to identify structural brain changes in depressed patients and established depression as a brain disease 
using positron emission tomography  pet  scan images  dr  helen mayberg of the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai  identified  in 2013  specific brain activity that can potentially predict whether people with major depressive disorder will best respond to an antidepressant medication or psychotherapy  this important new work offers a first potential imaging biomarker for treatment selection  a team of researchers including narsad grantee stefan g  hoffman  ph d   of boston university and frida e  polli  ph d   of massachusetts institute of technology have used brain imaging to predict the success of cognitive behavioral therapy  a specific type of talk therapy often used to help treat a wide range of mental illnesses including anxiety disorders  depression  and schizophrenia   research by dr  conor liston of weill cornell medical school  and colleagues  has used brain scans to identify four distinct “biotypes” of depression  strikingly  patients in one of these four categories were about three times more likely to respond to a noninvasive treatment known as transcranial magnetic stimulation  tms  than patients in two of the other categories  this is a good example of the power that biomarkers can have in the years just ahead to help direct people with depression to treatments most likely to help them 
</A>  
<Q>why have researchers so far failed to identify common gene mutations that contribute to risk for major depression</Q>
<A> variations in genes – different kinds of dna mutations  both common and rare – have been solidly linked to a number of serious psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia  bipolar disorder and autism  it is reasonable to wonder why similar progress has not been made yet in the study of the genetic factors contributing to depression  researchers have made many attempts to search for such factors  but have not come up with results that statisticians consider “statistically meaningful ” one way of explaining the issue in studying depression concerns that very large number of people whom it affects  the power of massive genomic studies of patients  who are compared with unaffected individuals  evaporates if the people being compared have similar illnesses that have very different underlying genetic profiles  people with major depression might be grouped according to sex  whether or not they have recurrent depression  age at onset  symptom patterns  whether or not they were abused or under chronic stress early in life  for example  there is very good reason for progress on the genetic front  however  foundation grantee patrick sullivan  m d  and others have had success in finding the first reliable signals of commonly seen genetic variations in people with schizophrenia  to do so  they need to assemble a patient sample  across continents  numbering in the tens of thousands  they founded the psychiatric genomic consortium to accomplish this  pgc scientists estimate that the inflection point in depression studies may be 75 000 to 100 000 study participants  a goal the pgc is working toward  it’s not that there is no genetic signal in depression  in other words  it’s a question of assembling a well documented sample of patients of sufficient size to “tease out” the embedded genetic “signals ” which will point toward risk genes for the illness 
</A> 
<Q>how to tell if you have depression</Q>
 <A>depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms 

they range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness  to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful  many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety 

there can be physical symptoms too  such as feeling constantly tired  sleeping badly  having no appetite or sex drive  and various aches and pains 

the symptoms of depression range from mild to severe  at its mildest  you may simply feel persistently low in spirit  while severe depression can make you feel suicidal  that life is no longer worth living 

most people experience feelings of stress  anxiety or low mood during difficult times  a low mood may improve after a short period of time  rather than being a sign of depression 
</A> 
<Q>when to see a doctor</Q>
<A> it s important to seek help from a gp if you think you may be depressed 

many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression  but it s best not to delay  the sooner you see a doctor  the sooner you can be on the way to recovery 
</A> 
<Q>what causes depression</Q>
 <A>sometimes there s a trigger for depression  life changing events  such as bereavement  losing your job or giving birth  can bring it on 

people with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves  but you can also become depressed for no obvious reason 
</A> 
<Q>how can depression be treated</Q>
<A> treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes  talking therapies and medicine  your recommended treatment will be based on whether you have mild  moderate or severe depression 

if you have mild depression  your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own  while monitoring your progress  this is known as  watchful waiting   they may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and self help groups 

talking therapies  such as cognitive behavioural therapy  cbt   are often used for mild depression that is not improving  or moderate depression  antidepressants are also sometimes prescribed 

for moderate to severe depression  a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended  if you have severe depression  you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine 
</A> 
<Q>how to live with depression</Q>
<A> many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes  such as getting more exercise  cutting down on alcohol  giving up smoking and eating healthily 

reading a self help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile  they can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed  sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive 
</A> 
<Q>what are the symptoms of clinical depression</Q>
<A> the symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people  if you re depressed  you may feel sad  hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy 

the symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work  social life and family life 

there are many other symptoms of depression and you re unlikely to have all of those listed on this page 

psychological symptoms
the psychological symptoms of depression include 

continuous low mood or sadness
feeling hopeless and helpless
having low self esteem
feeling tearful
feeling guilt ridden
feeling irritable and intolerant of others
having no motivation or interest in things
finding it difficult to make decisions
not getting any enjoyment out of life
feeling anxious or worried
having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself

physical symptoms
the physical symptoms of depression include 

moving or speaking more slowly than usual
changes in appetite or weight  usually decreased  but sometimes increased 
constipation
unexplained aches and pains
lack of energy
low sex drive  loss of libido 
changes to your menstrual cycle
disturbed sleep – for example  finding it difficult to fall asleep at night or waking up very early in the morning

social symptoms
the social symptoms of depression include 

avoiding contact with friends and taking part in fewer social activities
neglecting your hobbies and interests
having difficulties in your home  work or family life
</A> 
<Q>what are the severities of depression</Q>
 <A>depression can often come on gradually  so it can be difficult to notice something is wrong  many people try to cope with their symptoms without realising they re unwell  it can sometimes take a friend or family member to suggest something is wrong 

doctors describe depression by how serious it is 

mild depression – has some impact on your daily life
moderate depression – has a significant impact on your daily life
severe depression – makes it almost impossible to get through daily life  a few people with severe depression may have psychotic symptoms 
</A> 
<Q>what is the difference between grief and depression</Q>
<A> it can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression  they share many of the same characteristics  but there are important differences between them 

grief is an entirely natural response to a loss  while depression is an illness 

people who are grieving find their feelings of sadness and loss come and go  but they re still able to enjoy things and look forward to the future 

in contrast  people who are depressed constantly feel sad  they find it difficult to enjoy anything or be positive about the future 
</A> 
<Q>what are the other types of depression</Q> 
<A> there are different types of depression  and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms  these include 

postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers  fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby  this is known as postnatal depression and it s treated in a similar way to other types of depression  with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines 
bipolar disorder – also known as  manic depression   in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood  mania   the depression symptoms are similar to clinical depression  but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour  such as gambling  going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex 
seasonal affective disorder  sad  – also known as  winter depression   sad is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter 
</A> 
<Q>when to seek help</Q>
 <A>see a gp if you experience symptoms of depression for most of the day  every day  for more than 2 weeks 

a low mood may improve after a short time 
</A> 
<Q>what are the causes of clinical depression</Q>
<A> there s no single cause of depression  it can occur for a variety of reasons and it has many different triggers 

for some people  an upsetting or stressful life event  such as bereavement  divorce  illness  redundancy and job or money worries  can be the cause 

different causes can often combine to trigger depression  for example  you may feel low after being ill and then experience a traumatic event  such as a bereavement  which brings on depression 

people often talk about a  downward spiral  of events that leads to depression  for example  if your relationship with your partner breaks down  you re likely to feel low  you may stop seeing friends and family and you may start drinking more  all of this can make you feel worse and trigger depression 

some studies have also suggested that you re more likely to get depression as you get older  and that it s more common in people who live in difficult social and economic circumstances 

stressful events
most people take time to come to terms with stressful events  such as bereavement or a relationship breakdown  when these stressful events occur  your risk of becoming depressed is increased if you stop seeing your friends and family and try to deal with your problems on your own 

personality
you may be more vulnerable to depression if you have certain personality traits  such as low self esteem or being overly self critical  this may be because of the genes you ve inherited from your parents  your early life experiences  or both 

family history
if someone in your family has had depression in the past  such as a parent or sister or brother  it s more likely that you ll also develop it 

giving birth
some women are particularly vulnerable to depression after pregnancy  the hormonal and physical changes  as well as the added responsibility of a new life  can lead to postnatal depression 

loneliness
feelings of loneliness  caused by things such as becoming cut off from your family and friends can increase your risk of depression 

alcohol and drugs
when life is getting them down  some people try to cope by drinking too much alcohol or taking drugs  this can result in a spiral of depression  

cannabis can help you relax  but there s evidence that it can also bring on depression  particularly in teenagers 

 drowning your sorrows  with a drink is also not recommended  alcohol affects the chemistry of the brain  which increases the risk of depression 

illness
you may have a higher risk of depression if you have a longstanding or life threatening illness  such as coronary heart disease or cancer 

head injuries are also an often under recognised cause of depression  a severe head injury can trigger mood swings and emotional problems 

some people may have an underactive thyroid  hypothyroidism  resulting from problems with their immune system  in rarer cases  a minor head injury can damage the pituitary gland  which is a pea sized gland at the base of your brain that produces thyroid stimulating hormones 

this can cause a number of symptoms  such as extreme tiredness and a lack of interest in sex  loss of libido   which can in turn lead to depression 
</A> 
<Q>how can clinical depression be diagnosed</Q>
<A> if you experience symptoms of depression for most of the day  every day for more than 2 weeks  you should seek help from a gp 

it s particularly important to speak to a gp if you 

have symptoms of depression that are not improving
find your mood affects your work  other interests  and relationships with your family and friends
have thoughts of suicide or self harm
sometimes  when you re depressed it can be difficult to imagine that treatment can actually help  but the sooner you seek treatment  the sooner your depression will improve 

there are no physical tests for depression  but a gp may examine you and carry out some urine or blood tests to rule out other conditions that have similar symptoms  such as an underactive thyroid 

the main way a gp will tell if you have depression is by asking you questions about your general health and how the way you re feeling is affecting you mentally and physically 

try to be as open and honest as you can be with your answers  describing your symptoms and how they re affecting you will help the gp determine whether you have depression and how severe it is 

any discussion you have with a gp will be confidential  this rule will only ever be broken if there s a significant risk of harm to either yourself or others  and if informing a family member or carer would reduce that risk 
</A> 
<Q>how can clinical depression be treated</Q>
<A> treatment for depression usually involves a combination of self help  talking therapies and medicines 

the treatment recommended will be based on the type of depression you have 

mild depression
if you have mild depression  the following treatments may be recommended 

wait and see
if a gp diagnoses you with mild depression  they may suggest waiting a short time to see if it gets better by itself  in this case  you ll be seen again by the gp after 2 weeks to monitor your progress  this is known as watchful waiting 

exercise
there s evidence that exercise can help depression  and it s one of the main treatments for mild depression  you may be referred to a group exercise class 

find out more about walking for health and exercise for depression 

self help
talking through your feelings can be helpful  you could talk to a friend or relative  or you could ask a gp or local talking therapies service if there are any self help groups for people with depression in your area 

you could try self help books or online cognitive behavioural therapy  cbt  

mild to moderate depression
if you have mild to moderate depression that is not improving  or moderate depression  you may find a talking therapy helpful 

there are different types of talking therapies for depression  including cognitive behavioural therapy  cbt  and counselling 

a gp can refer you for talking treatment  or you can refer yourself directly to an nhs talking therapies service without a referral from a gp 

moderate to severe depression
if you have moderate to severe depression  the following treatments may be recommended 

antidepressants
antidepressants are medicines that treat the symptoms of depression  there are many different types of antidepressant 

they have to be prescribed by a doctor  usually for depression that s moderate or severe 

combination therapy
a gp may recommend that you take a course of antidepressants plus talking therapy  particularly if your depression is quite severe 

a combination of an antidepressant and cbt usually works better than having just one of these treatments 

mental health teams
if you have severe depression  you may be referred to a mental health team made up of psychologists  psychiatrists  specialist nurses and occupational therapists 

these teams often provide intensive specialist talking treatments as well as prescribed medicine 

talking treatments
cognitive behavioural therapy  cbt 
cognitive behavioural therapy  cbt  aims to help you understand your thoughts and behaviour  and how they affect you 

cbt recognises that events in your past may have shaped you  but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think  feel and behave in the present 

it teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example  being able to challenge hopeless feelings 

cbt is available on the nhs for people with depression or any other mental health problem it s been shown to help 

if cbt is recommended  you ll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks 

the course of treatment usually lasts for between 5 and 20 sessions  with each session lasting 30 to 60 minutes 

in some cases  you may be offered group cbt 

online cbt
online cbt is a type of cbt delivered through a computer  rather than face to face with a therapist 

you ll have a series of weekly sessions and should receive support from a healthcare professional 

interpersonal therapy  ipt 
interpersonal therapy  ipt  focuses on your relationships with others and problems you may be having in your relationships  such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement 

there s some evidence that ipt can be as effective as antidepressants or cbt  but more research is needed 

psychodynamic psychotherapy
in psychodynamic  psychoanalytic  psychotherapy  a psychoanalytic therapist will encourage you to say whatever is going through your mind 

this will help you become aware of hidden meanings or patterns in what you do or say that may be contributing to your problems 

counselling
counselling is a form of therapy that helps you think about the problems you re experiencing in your life so you can find new ways of dealing with them 

counsellors support you in finding solutions to problems  but do not tell you what to do  you can talk in confidence to a counsellor  who supports you and offers practical advice 

on the nhs  you may be offered a single session of counselling  a short course of sessions over a few weeks or months  or a longer course that lasts for several months or years 

it s ideal for people who are generally healthy but need help coping with a current crisis  such as anger  relationship issues  bereavement  redundancy  infertility or a serious illness 

getting help
see a gp for more information about accessing nhs talking treatments  they can refer you for local talking treatments for depression 

you also have the option of self referral  this means that if you prefer not to talk to a gp  you can go directly to an nhs talking therapies service 

antidepressants
antidepressants are medicines that treat the symptoms of depression  there are many different types available 

most people with moderate or severe depression benefit from antidepressants  but not everybody does  

you may respond to 1 antidepressant but not to another  and you may need to try 2 or more treatments before you find one that works for you 

the different types of antidepressant work about as well as each other  but side effects vary between different treatments and people 

when you start taking antidepressants  you should see a gp or specialist nurse every week or 2 for at least 4 weeks to assess how well they re working 

if they re working  you ll need to continue taking them at the same dose for at least 4 to 6 months after your symptoms have eased 

if you have had episodes of depression in the past  you may need to continue to take antidepressants for up to 5 years or more 

antidepressants are not addictive  but you may get some withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly or you miss a dose 

selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  ssris 
if a gp thinks you d benefit from taking an antidepressant  you ll usually be prescribed a modern type called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  ssri  

examples of commonly used ssri antidepressants are paroxetine  seroxat   fluoxetine  prozac  and citalopram  cipramil  

they help increase the level of a natural chemical in your brain called serotonin  which is thought to be a  good mood  chemical 

ssris work just as well as older antidepressants and have fewer side effects  although they can cause nausea  headaches  a dry mouth and problems having sex  but these side effects usually improve over time 

some ssris are not suitable for children and young people under 18 years of age  research shows that the risk of self harm and suicidal behaviour may increase if they re taken by under 18s 

fluoxetine is the only ssri that can be prescribed for under 18s and  even then  only when a specialist has given the go ahead 

tricyclic antidepressants  tcas 
tricyclic antidepressants  tcas  are a group of antidepressants used to treat moderate to severe depression 

tcas  including imipramine  imipramil  and amitriptyline  have been around for longer than ssris 

they work by raising the levels of the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain  these both help lift your mood  

they re generally quite safe  but it s a bad idea to smoke cannabis if you re taking tcas because it can cause your heart to beat rapidly 

side effects of tcas vary from person to person but may include a dry mouth  blurred vision  constipation  problems passing urine  sweating  feeling lightheaded and excessive drowsiness 

the side effects usually ease within 10 days as your body gets used to the medicine 

vortioxetine
vortioxetine  brintellix or lundbeck  is recommended by the national institute for health and care excellence  nice  for treating adults who are having a first or recurrent major depressive episode  if the current episode has not responded to 2 other antidepressants 

common side effects associated with vortioxetine include abnormal dreams  constipation  diarrhoea  dizziness  itching  nausea and vomiting 

other antidepressants
new antidepressants  such as venlafaxine  efexor   duloxetine  cymbalta or yentreve  and mirtazapine  zispin soltab   work in a slightly different way from ssris and tcas 

venlafaxine and duloxetine are known as serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors  snris   like tcas  they change the levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain 

studies have shown that an snri can be more effective than an ssri  but they re not routinely prescribed because they can lead to a rise in blood pressure 
</A> 
<Q>what are some withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking antidepressants</Q>
<A> antidepressants are not addictive in the same way that illegal drugs and cigarettes are  but you may have some withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking them 

these include 

an upset stomach
flu like symptoms
anxiety
dizziness
vivid dreams at night
sensations in the body that feel like electric shocks
in most cases  these are quite mild and last no longer than 1 or 2 weeks  but occasionally they can be quite severe 

they seem to be most likely to occur with paroxetine  seroxat  and venlafaxine  efexor  

withdrawal symptoms occur very soon after stopping the tablets so are easy to distinguish from symptoms of depression relapse  which tend to occur after a few weeks 
</A> 
<Q>what are other treatments for depression</Q>
<A> mindfulness
mindfulness involves paying closer attention to the present moment  and focusing on your thoughts  feelings  bodily sensations and the world around you to improve your mental wellbeing 

the aim is to develop a better understanding of your mind and body  and learn how to live with more appreciation and less anxiety 

mindfulness is recommended by nice as a way of preventing depression in people who have had 3 or more bouts of depression in the past 

st john s wort
st john s wort is a herbal treatment that some people take for depression  it s available from health food shops and pharmacies 

there s some evidence that it may help mild to moderate depression  but it s not recommended by doctors 

this is because the amount of active ingredients varies among individual brands and batches  so you can never be sure what sort of effect it ll have on you 

taking st john s wort with other medicines  such as anticonvulsants  anticoagulants  antidepressants and the contraceptive pill  can also cause serious problems 

you should not take st john s wort if you re pregnant or breastfeeding  as we do not know for sure that it s safe 

also  st john s wort can interact with the contraceptive pill  reducing its effectiveness

</A> 
<Q>what are the major symptoms of depression</Q>

<A> common symptoms of more severe depressions include depressed mood  of course    appetite changes — either increased or decreased  sleep changes — either more sleep such as taking naps after sleeping all night  or decreased sleep  decreased motivation to do things and decreased enjoyment of things that usually are enjoyable is also very common 

anxiety and depression seem to go together so many people notice an increase in worries and feeling like they can’t stop thinking about things that are problems  others might notice that the depressed individual is very negative about almost everything  even things that most people would see as positives 

of course  we worry a lot about suicidal ideation  if someone has suicidal thoughts  it is vitally important that they tell someone they trust  call a suicide hotline or their physician and get assistance  depressions will always go away with treatment eventually and it is tragic when someone ends their life when treatment may have been lifesaving 
</A>

as important  negativity goes along with being sad  depressed individuals tend to see the worst and assume the worst about everything  common thoughts are   my medication won’t help    what’s the use of doing anything   and so on  we see people end up in a downward spiral in which everything they do that might be helpful is discounted and everything that is negative further reinforces the negativity

</A> 
<Q>if you love someone with depression  why is it important to know if these symptoms are getting worse for them  how might that indicate how you should act  what should you do if you notice that a loved one s depression symptoms are worsening</Q>

</A> 
<Q>how can you tell if someone is considering suicide and how can you intervene  what should you do if you fear this</Q>

 <A>if you are worried  you should always ask  asking someone if they are thinking about ending their life  as hard as that may be to do  is not going to make someone more likely to do anything  in fact  it may be lifesaving  if you believe someone is highly at risk  get help  get them to an emergency room  your local community mental health center or call their physicians office  don’t let them be alone 
</A> 
<Q>how should you encourage your loved one to seek help for their depression  what are some examples of things to say or do</Q>
